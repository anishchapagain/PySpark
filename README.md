PySpark - Big Data Analysis

PySpark is an interface for Apache Spark in Python. 

It not only allows you to write Spark applications using Python APIs, but also provides the PySpark shell for interactively analyzing your data in a distributed environment.

PySpark library to apply SQL-like analysis on a huge amount of structured or semi-structured data. 

We can also use SQL queries with PySparkSQL. It can also be connected to Apache Hive. HiveQL can be also be applied. PySparkSQL is a wrapper over the PySpark core.

PySparkSQL introduced the DataFrame, a tabular representation of structured data that is similar to that of a table from a relational database management system.

PySpark SQL is a module in Spark which integrates relational processing with Spark's functional programming API. We can extract the data by using an SQL query language. We can use the queries same as the SQL language.
